# 5 Thinks I have learned about git and gitHub

#### 1. Version Control

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code. It allows multiple people to work on a project without overwriting each other's work, providing a history of all changes for reference or rollback if needed.

#### 2. Repositories

A repository (or repo) in Git is a storage space where your project files and their revision history are kept. In GitHub, repositories are hosted online, making them accessible to collaborators or the public.

#### 3. Branching and Merging

Branches allow you to create independent versions of your project for testing new features or fixing bugs. Once you're satisfied with your changes, you can merge them back into the main branch (often called "master" or "main") without affecting the live version during development.

#### 4. Collaboration and Pull Requests

GitHub facilitates collaboration by allowing contributors to make changes on branches, which are then reviewed through pull requests before being merged into the main project. This allows for code review, discussion, and feedback.

#### 5. Commit and Push

Commit saves your changes locally, while push uploads them to a remote repository like GitHub. This separation allows you to experiment and perfect your changes locally before sharing them with others or updating the official project version.

#### 6. Forking

Forking a repository in GitHub creates a personal copy of someone else's project. You can make changes in your own version, experiment, and then submit a pull request to propose these changes to the original project, allowing for open-source collaboration.

#### 7. Issues and Project Management

GitHub provides an issues feature that allows developers to track bugs, suggest new features, or manage tasks. It's a way to organize work, assign tasks to team members, and document project progress, making it a valuable tool for project management.
